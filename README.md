# NodeJS Udemy - TypeScript Remake

I have recreated a part of the projects I initially learned in NodeJS, with some upgrades such as **TypeScript** and **MVC** architecture.

To check out the "old" version based solely on the course content, you can visit [this repository](https://github.com/mwives/nodejs-udemy).

## Projects

In this repository, you'll discover the Back-end for the first two of the three primary applications: Weather, Task, and Chat apps.

### Weather App ‚òÅÔ∏è

The Weather App leverages two external APIs: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

As a plus, it efficiently retrieves weather forecasts for the next 7 days.

### Task App üìù

Similar to the original version, the Task App incorporates **MongoDB** with Mongoose, **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens), **SendGrid** for email sending, and **Jest** for testing.

In this updated version, alongside TypeScript, the **MVC pattern** has been implemented for enhanced organization and maintainability. It also includes the use of **Refresh Tokens** for added security and implements more comprehensive testing procedures.
