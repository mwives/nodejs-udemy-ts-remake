# NodeJS Udemy - TS Remake

I remade (part of) the projects from the course that I used to first learn NodeJS. This time, I used some new technologies and practices, such as **TypeScript** and **MVC**.

Click [here](https://github.com/mwives/nodejs-udemy) to access the "old" version.

## Projects

In this repository, you'll find the Back-end of the first two of the three main apps, which is Weather, Task and Chat apps.

Currently, I'm learning ReactJS, so I can build a full version (with Front-end) of those three apps.

### Weather App ‚òÅÔ∏è

This consumes two external APIs: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).



The main difference from the original version, is that this doesn't have a Front-end (yet) and fecthes the forecast for the next 7 days.

### Task App üìù

Just as the original one, I used **Mongoose**, **JWT**, **SendGrid** and **Jest**.

The main difference in this one, is that besides TypeScript, this uses the **MVC pattern**, **Refresh Tokens** and **more complex tests**.
